The starter project initially provided some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. I converted this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.
The page scrolls smoothly, highlishts the active section and link, and has a fully functioning navigation bar.
